# mulkiya-web

This is the backend API of the Mulkiya application. Mulkiya application is a platform that reminds drivers when their car registration is about to expire. 

This tool is specifically build to be used for drivers in Oman. Typically, people in Oman have many cars in their homes as it is the most reliable means of transportation. This means that people need to remember to renew the car registration for each vehicle. Our tool is meant to allow people to relax and trust that they will be notified when the registration is about to expire.
